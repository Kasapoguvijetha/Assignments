    Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water to form a thick, viscous liquid.<br> Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrance.<br>In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container. <br>The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit.<br> Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations. <br>While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward.<br> For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation.<br> While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective.<br>
