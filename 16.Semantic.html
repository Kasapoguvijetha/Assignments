        Shampoo is typically used to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum (natural oils) in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable.<br> Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water. <br>The sulfate ingredient acts as a surfactant, trapping oils and other contaminants, similarly to soap.<br>

    In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week.<br> This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing.<br> Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp.<br> This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing.<br> According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp.<br>
